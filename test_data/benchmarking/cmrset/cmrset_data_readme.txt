The folder contains catchment averaged actual evapotranspiration esitmates derived from the CMRSET (Guerschman, et al, 2009) MODIS satellite derived product.

Data was processed by Luigi Renzullo to match AWRA-L spatial reolution. Then the data was averaged over AWRA-L umpimpaired catchment dataset.

Scaling of potential evapotranspiration with MODIS data reproduces flux observations and catchment water balance observations across Australia. Journal of Hydrology, 369(1-2): 107-119.
